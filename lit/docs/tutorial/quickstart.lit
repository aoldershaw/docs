\use-plugin{concourse-docs}

Concourse is distributed as a single \code{concourse} binary, making it easy
to run just about anywhere, especially with Docker.

If you'd like to get Concourse running somewhere quickly so you can start
to kick the tires, the easiest way is to use the Docker Compose quick-start:

\codeblock{bash}{{
$ wget https://concourse-ci.org/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating docs_concourse-db_1 ...
Creating docs_concourse-db_1 ... done
Creating docs_concourse_1 ...
Creating docs_concourse_1 ... done
}}

Concourse will be running at \link{localhost:8080}{http://localhost:8080}.
You can log in with the username/password as \code{test}/\code{test}.

Next, install the \reference{fly-cli} by downloading it from the web UI and
target your local Concourse as the \code{test} user:

\codeblock{bash}{{
$ fly -t tutorial login -c http://localhost:8080 -u test -p test
logging in to team 'main'

target saved
}}

Once you've confirmed everything is up and running, you can move onto the next
section.
